# Computer Architecture and Operating System Projects

Welcome to my repository for the Computer Architecture and Operating System course! This repository contains my solutions for the three projects I completed during the course.

## Contents

- **Project 1**: Library for simulating NAND gates in C. [Project description](./Zal1/README.md)
- **Project 2**: Function for dividing n*64 bits number by 64 bit number in NASM. [Project description](./Zal2/README.md)
- **Project 3**: Program for calculating [CRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) for a file in NASM. [Project description](./Zal3/README.md)

## Environment Setup

I've also included the environment setup and testing scripts I used to ensure the correctness of my solutions.

## Getting Started

To get started with my projects:

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/MrD4rkne/CAOS.git
```

2. Follow instructions from one of projects' subdirectories:
- [./Zal1/README.md](./Zal1/README.md)
- [./Zal2/README.md](./Zal2/README.md)
- [./Zal3/README.md](./Zal3/README.md)
